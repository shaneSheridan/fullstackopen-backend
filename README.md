# Node.js Backend

This is a Node.js backend that serves `Note` resources and is based on the [fullstackopen course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents) which is offered for free by the University of Helsinki.

The REST API can be exercised with the files in the `request` directory and the [VS Code REST client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).
